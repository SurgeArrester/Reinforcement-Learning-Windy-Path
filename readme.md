# Windy Path

This is an implementation of the windy path problem as defined in Figure 6.4 of reinforcement learning by Sutton & Barto

We take a four by twelve grid along the bottom of which is a strong wind which blows an agent to the starting position. We train an agent to navigate through the grid in the shortest and safest possible route, through an exploration of both SARSA and Q-Learning methods to get the optimal route.
